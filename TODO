Feature roadmap for OpenRocket 1.0


Must-have:

- Draw remaining event icons (for 0.9.3)
- Change automatic exception reporting success code to 202 (for 0.9.3)
- Test automatic exception reporting (for 0.9.3)

- Allow editing user-defined materials
- Go through thrust curves and correct errors
- Add styrofoam and depron materials
- Through-the-wall fins
- Update "About" dialog with icon and source info


Bugs:

- Simulation plot dialog forces dialog one button row too high (All/None)
- JTree text is cropped unnecessarily
- BUG: Inner tube cluster rotation, edit with spinner arrows, slider wrong


Maybe:

- Make ThicknessRingComponent implement RadialParent and allow
  attaching components to a TubeCoupler
- Reading thrust curves from external directory


Postponed:

- Allow only one instance of OpenRocket running (RMI communication)
- Only schedule rocket figure update instead of each time updating it
- Reading (writing) .RKT format
- Importing flight data
- Water rocket modelling
- Landing scatter plots


Done:

- Search field in motor selection dialog
- Motor selection/editing from Edit configurations dialog
- Change FreeformFinSet to throw checked exceptions
- Fix engine block icons
- Exporting flight data
- Split cluster into separate components
- Create application icon and take into use
- Error dialog for uncaught exceptions
- Check where plot data ends (all rest NaN)
- Example rocket designs (hybrid w/ dual deployment, staged rocket)
- Better error/warning dialogs when reading/writing files
- Store custom materials
- Read more thrust curve formats
- Showing events in plots
- Table boolean selecting by clicking label
