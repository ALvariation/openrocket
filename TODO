Feature roadmap for OpenRocket 1.0


Must-have:

- Store custom materials
- Create application icon and take into use
- Better error/warning dialogs when reading/writing files
- Error dialog for uncaught exceptions
- Split cluster into separate components
- Example rocket designs (hybrid w/ dual deployment, staged rocket)


Bugs:

- Debug stage simulation
- Sometimes saves wrong?
- Simulation time step not loaded correctly from files??
- JTree text is cropped unnecessarily


Maybe:

- Showing events in plots
- Through-the-wall fins
- Make ThicknessRingComponent implement RadialParent and allow
  attaching components to a TubeCoupler
- Reading thrust curves from external directory
- Read more thrust curve formats / go through thrust curves and correct errors
- Only schedule rocket figure update instead of each time updating it


Postponed:

- Reading (writing) .RKT format
- Importing flight data
- Water rocket modelling
- Landing scatter plots


Done:

- Search field in motor selection dialog
- Motor selection/editing from Edit configurations dialog
- Change FreeformFinSet to throw checked exceptions
- Fix engine block icons
- Exporting flight data
