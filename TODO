Must-have:

- Exporting flight data
- Store custom materials
- Read more thrust curve formats / go through thrust curves and correct errors
- Create application icon and take into use
- Better error/warning dialogs when reading/writing files


Maybe:

- Reading (writing) .RKT format
- Showing events in plots
- Through-the-wall fins
- Make ThicknessRingComponent implement RadialParent and allow
  attaching components to a TubeCoupler
- Reading thrust curves from external directory


Postponed:

- Importing flight data
- Water rocket modelling
- Landing scatter plots


Done:

- Search field in motor selection dialog
- Motor selection/editing from Edit configurations dialog
- Change FreeformFinSet to throw checked exceptions
