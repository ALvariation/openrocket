Feature roadmap for OpenRocket 1.0


Must-have:

- Go through thrust curves and correct errors
- Add styrofoam and depron materials


Bugs:

- Unit tests fail from ant script


Maybe:

- Inform user about software updates


Postponed:

- Windows executable wrapper (launch4j)
- Allow only one instance of OpenRocket running (RMI communication)
- Only schedule rocket figure update instead of each time updating it
- Reading (writing) .RKT format
- Importing flight data (file/altimeter)
- Water rocket modelling
- Landing scatter plots
- Simulate other branches
- Implement setDefaults() method for RocketComponent
- BUG: Inner tube cluster rotation, edit with spinner arrows, slider wrong
- Reading thrust curves from external directory
- NAR/CNES/etc competition validity checking
- Running from command line
- Print support
- Saving as SVG


Refactoring tasks:

- Move startup class to src14 directory, remove reflection
- Remove database etc. initialization from class initialization,
  create separate set of test motors
- Extract event rules and data saving from Simulator into listeners
- Change SimulationStatus to include methods for obtaining basic
  position (maybe even change to an interface, implements Cloneable)
- Change Motor (immutable) to be a factory of MotorInstance (stateful)



Done:

- Search field in motor selection dialog
- Motor selection/editing from Edit configurations dialog
- Change FreeformFinSet to throw checked exceptions
- Fix engine block icons
- Exporting flight data
- Split cluster into separate components
- Create application icon and take into use
- Error dialog for uncaught exceptions
- Check where plot data ends (all rest NaN)
- Example rocket designs (hybrid w/ dual deployment, staged rocket)
- Better error/warning dialogs when reading/writing files
- Store custom materials
- Read more thrust curve formats
- Showing events in plots
- Table boolean selecting by clicking label
- Test automatic exception reporting (for 0.9.3)
- Draw remaining event icons (for 0.9.3)
- Update "About" dialog with icon and source info
In 0.9.4:
- Through-the-wall fins
- Make ThicknessRingComponent implement RadialParent and allow
  attaching components to a TubeCoupler  (for 0.9.4)
- Save file as oldest OpenRocket format possible  (for 0.9.4)
- Non-exception bug handling
- JTree text is cropped unnecessarily
- Allow editing user-defined materials
- [BUG] All configuration dialogs too high
- Simulation plot dialog forces dialog one button row too high (All/None)
